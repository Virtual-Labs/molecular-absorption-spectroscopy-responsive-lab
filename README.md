This repository contains the "Flash to Javascript Converion" sources for the Molecular Absorption Spectroscopy Lab. 
##### Steps followed in the conversion of flash to JavaScript.
* Get the .swf file of the flash experiment which needs to be converted to JavaScript.

* Using JPEXS free Flash Decompiler extract all the components of the experiment.

* Combine parts of the Images obtained among the components extracted to form the required images using photoshop.

* Combine these images to one or more form frames.

* Position all the frames in their appropriate positions in HTML and CSS code.

* Place transparent image buttons over the frames in the places which should be clickable.

* On clicking these buttons replace the frame with a necessary frame and replace the button image with an appropriate one and provide desired animations to it.

* To plot the graph, since the data is not available, capture the screen of graph plotting from the flash experiment and play the video when 'scan' button is pressed.

##### Additional things used apart from pure JavaScript are
* jQueryRotate.js for rotating certain images.
